Best to not use them as they can cause issues to the server.\n- If eating base Harvestcraft crops (ones gotten from gardens) then look at the sky while eating to actually eat it.\n- Rogue Dungeons, Loot Games, AE2 Meteors & Natura Redwood Tree's are Disabled to keep the Surface looking nicer for the longevity of the server.\n- You can Purchase AE2 Skystone via the Coin Shop later on.\n- Most Commands and Land Claim info is found via the /help command.\n- There is no Bed Voting on the server. Just protect your land and build wall and don't bug players to sleep.\n- The Only Chunk Loaders allowed are Railcraft and it's HIGHLY recommended you stick to the personal ones. \n- Take your time,  build a nice looking base and don't rush the Pack. You will end up burning out,  hating people once you start lagging / crashing it and just overall have a bad time if you rush things. \n\nÂ§c[url]https://discord.gg/kBTabCX[/url]"
