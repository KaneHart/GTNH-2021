Nether WILL be wiped at the beginning of each month.\n- Properties left alone for over 30 days will be considered abandoned and may be disabled/removed by admins. Do NOT ask admins to do this just because you want that prime land someone made.\n- Do NOT Build within 500 blocks of another player without permission.\n- Do NOT Build within 1000 Blocks of a bunker.\n- Report any potential Bugs / Issues on our Github /help for link.\n- For any other info, please visit us on our Discord /help for link.\n\nPlease remember this is a shared server with other players. Most of our core members who play on our servers take their time and don't rush into the high tiers and make others end up suffering from your abuse of resources. Spend more time building nice bases, structures, rail system, etc. We are a Community Server!\n\n\n\n§c[url]https://discord.gg/kBTabCX[/url]"
