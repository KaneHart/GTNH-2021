You can also just go directly to §S§2§1§n[url]StoneLegion.com[/url]§r§r for more information! \n\nWe recommend that you don't leave the safety of spawn or the 13k-13k bunker anytime other than early morning as that will give you the most time to collect the dirt, logs and gravel for the first 2 quests giving you a torch and access to basic tools. If you don't run/jump much before you create a farm, then you shouldn't need to hunt any mobs for food. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this server is meant to be a more community friendly / TPS friendly server. We are not Interested in players who are here to grind to max as fast as possible and brag about it in chat. Most of our core players play slow and steady and work on side projects, like the Rail System.\n\n§3Hopefully you didn't get munched by a monster while reading this.\n\n\n\n§c[url]https://discord.gg/kBTabCX[/url]"
