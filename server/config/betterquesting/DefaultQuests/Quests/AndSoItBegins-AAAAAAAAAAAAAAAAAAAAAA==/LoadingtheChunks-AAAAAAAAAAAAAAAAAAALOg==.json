We use exclusively use Chunkloader Coin's from NEI.\n\nPlease remember this is a shared server with shared worlds. Don't be spamming chunk loaders all over the place and pick them up when you don't need to use them anymore. Please use mostly passive anchors when possible.\n\nOne the big reasons to use Passive Anchors is that if a chunk loaded base were to cause server lag/crash (its been known to happen) we can temporarily isolate those chunks so that others players can still enjoy playing while the issue is being worked on. Another good reason is so that players with automation (who disable their chunkloaders and automation) don't lag the server even though some don't play anymore.\n\nSo remember play fair and play slow!\n\n\n\n§c[url]https://discord.gg/kBTabCX[/url]"
