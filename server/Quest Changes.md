This is not meant to add or remove and or modify quests rewards, etc. This is just to display our info on quests that normally are info placeholders for server admins and people playing single player. 








## Your First Night:

We recommend that you don't leave the safety of spawn or the 4k4k bunker anytime other than early morning as that will give you the most time to collect the dirt, logs and gravel for the first 2 quests giving you a torch and access to basic tools. If you don't run/jump much before you create a farm, then you shouldn't need to hunt any mobs for food. 

Welcome to the StoneLegion.com Server! If you like to know more info about our server, rules, etc type in §4/help§r and all the links are clickable. You can also just go directly to §S§2StoneLegion.com§r for more information! 

§3Hopefully you didn't get munched by a monster while reading this.









## Mushroom Biomes? Why Are There So Many?
"Server Rules!"

Welcome to our Server Rules.
Last Updated 06/02/2021

- Do NOT annoy players/admins.
- Do NOT lag the server and make sure to disable any automation if you're away.
- Do NOT cheat/exploit/steal/etc.
- Do NOT be greedy with loot, world gen, server ticks, etc (the server world and hardware are SHARED between all players)
- Only the Overworld is backed up and other worlds may be wiped. Nether WILL be wiped at the beginning of each month.
- Properties left alone for over 30 days will be considered abandoned and may be disabled/removed by admins. Do NOT ask admins to do this just because you want that prime land someone made.
- Do NOT build within 300 blocks of another player without permission.
- Report any potential Bugs / Issues on our Github /help for link.
- For any other info, please visit us on our Discord /help for link.

Please remember this is a shared server with other players. Most of our core members who play on our servers take their time and don't rush into the high tiers and make others end up suffering from your abuse of resources. Spend more time building nice bases, structures, rail system, etc. We are a Community Server!









## Better Questing?
"Basic Tips!"

If eating base Harvestcraft crops (ones gotten from gardens) then look at the sky while eating to actually eat it.










## Backup Your Stuff...
"Help Build a Railroad System!"

Did you know Stone Legion formally known as Godcraft had the biggest Vanilla Rail System in Minecraft for the longest time?

We love Railroads and yes there are many "Cheaty" methods of transportation in GTNH. That being said it does not mean we block them or force you to use specific forms of transportation. We can have fun creating community based projects like a GTNH Railcraft System.

We hope people will consider making nice Paths, Bridges, community farms and even in the futue Railroads to other players and help connect our community / server. 

Try to build bridges with at least 2 air blocks above water.

How awesome would it be if we could show the GTNH Community the fun and cool ways of Railcraft and a massive system around the Server. 

This is part of why were are consider a more slower community. We don't Rush not Max Tier's, etc. Instead we take our time and we attempt to make a more community focused and interactive server. 

As time goes on and our community grows, we can do community videos and tours around the server.

So Consider being part of the community and work on fun projects to welcome new players and keep old players engaged! 










## Loading the Chunks

This pack & Server uses Anchor from Railcraft to keep chunks loaded. We use exclusively use Chunkloader Coin's from NEI.

Please remember this is a shared server with shared worlds. Don't be spamming chunk loaders all over the place and pick them up when you don't need to use them anymore. Please use mostly passive anchors when possible.

One the big reasons to use Passive Anchors is that if a chunk loaded base were to cause server lag/crash (its been known to happen) we can temporarily isolate those chunks so that others players can still enjoy playing while the issue is being worked on. Another good reason is so that players with automation (who disable their chunkloaders and automation) don't lag the server even though some don't play anymore.

So remember play fair and play slow!









## All Alone in the Night

- This is the one about using /bq_admin so we can replace this with something as well?
