This is not meant to add or remove and or modify quests rewards, etc. This is just to display our info on quests that normally are info placeholders for server admins and people playing single player. 








## Your First Night:

Welcome to the StoneLegion.com Server! If you like to know more info about our server, rules, etc type in §4/help§r and all the links are clickable. You can also just go directly to §S§2StoneLegion.com§r for more information! 

We recommend that you don't leave the safety of spawn or the 4k4k bunker anytime other than early morning as that will give you the most time to collect the dirt, logs and gravel for the first 2 quests giving you a torch and access to basic tools. If you don't run/jump much before you create a farm, then you shouldn't need to hunt any mobs for food. 

Please keep in mind that this server is meant to be a more community friendly / TPS friendly server. We are not Interested in players who are here to grind to max as fast as possible and brag about it in chat. Most of our core players play slow and steady and work on side projects, like the Rail System.

§3Hopefully you didn't get munched by a monster while reading this.









## Mushroom Biomes? Why Are There So Many?
"Server Rules!"

Welcome to our Server Rules.
Last Updated 06/21/2021

- Do NOT annoy players/admins.
- Do NOT lag the server and make sure to disable any automation if you're away.
- Do NOT cheat/exploit/steal/etc.
- Do NOT use Banned Items & Blocks (They will say so via NEI).
- Do NOT be greedy with loot, world gen, server ticks, etc (the server world and hardware are SHARED between all players)
- Only the Overworld is backed up and other worlds may be wiped. Nether WILL be wiped at the beginning of each month.
- Properties left alone for over 30 days will be considered abandoned and may be disabled/removed by admins. Do NOT ask admins to do this just because you want that prime land someone made.
- Do NOT build within 300 blocks of another player without permission.
- Report any potential Bugs / Issues on our Github /help for link.
- For any other info, please visit us on our Discord /help for link.

Please remember this is a shared server with other players. Most of our core members who play on our servers take their time and don't rush into the high tiers and make others end up suffering from your abuse of resources. Spend more time building nice bases, structures, rail system, etc. We are a Community Server!









## Better Questing?
"Basic Tips!"

Welcome to the Stone Legion's FAQ's Page.
Last Updated 06/21/2021

- There is a Strange bug With Tinkers Bronze Swords found in chests. Best to not use them as they can cause issues to the server.
- If eating base Harvestcraft crops (ones gotten from gardens) then look at the sky while eating to actually eat it.
- Rogue Dungeons, Loot Games, AE2 Meteors & Natura Redwood Tree's are Disabled to keep the Surface looking nicer for the longevity of the server.
- You can Purchase AE2 Skystone via the Coin Shop later on.
- Most Commands and Land Claim info is found via the /help command.
- There is no Bed Voting on the server. Just protect your land and build wall and don't bug players to sleep.
- The Only Chunk Loaders allowed are Railcraft and it's HIGHLY recommended you stick to the personal ones. 
- Take your time,  build a nice looking base and don't rush the Pack. You will end up burning out,  hating people once you start lagging / crashing it and just overall have a bad time if you rush things. 










## Backup Your Stuff...
"Help Build a Railroad System!"

Did you know Stone Legion formally known as Godcraft had the biggest Vanilla Rail System in Minecraft for the longest time?

We love Railroads and yes there are many "Cheaty" methods of transportation in GTNH. That being said it does not mean we block them or force you to use specific forms of transportation. We can have fun creating community based projects like a GTNH Railcraft System.

We hope people will consider making nice Paths, Bridges, community farms and even in the futue Railroads to other players and help connect our community / server. 

Try to build bridges with at least 2 air blocks above water.

How awesome would it be if we could show the GTNH Community the fun and cool ways of Railcraft and a massive system around the Server. 

This is part of why were are consider a more slower community. We don't Rush not Max Tier's, etc. Instead we take our time and we attempt to make a more community focused and interactive server. 

As time goes on and our community grows, we can do community videos and tours around the server.

So Consider being part of the community and work on fun projects to welcome new players and keep old players engaged! 










## Loading the Chunks

This pack & Server uses Anchor from Railcraft to keep chunks loaded. We use exclusively use Chunkloader Coin's from NEI.

Please remember this is a shared server with shared worlds. Don't be spamming chunk loaders all over the place and pick them up when you don't need to use them anymore. Please use mostly passive anchors when possible.

One the big reasons to use Passive Anchors is that if a chunk loaded base were to cause server lag/crash (its been known to happen) we can temporarily isolate those chunks so that others players can still enjoy playing while the issue is being worked on. Another good reason is so that players with automation (who disable their chunkloaders and automation) don't lag the server even though some don't play anymore.

So remember play fair and play slow!









## All Alone in the Night

This is 100% a useless quest never meant for Multiplayer... Will come up with something later here to fill in!




## §1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...

Sleepy time, and the end of the tutorial. Congratulations, you've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in tier 0!

Keep in Mind that there is not sleep voting on the server. This means you have to wait out the night and the best way to do this is make a base with walls and light it up!
